## Backend Placeholder

This directory is reserved for future API or server code that will power the Rabbit e-commerce platform.

- Add Express, Nest, or any other backend stack here.
- Keep backend `package.json` and environment files scoped inside this folder.
- Update the root `README.md` once backend services are implemented.
